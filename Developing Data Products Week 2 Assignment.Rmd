## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.

## Review criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that youâ€™re grading this assignment?
Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?

## Submission

Here is the Gandhi Ashram, Kankaria Lake, Sidi Saiyad Mosque, Sabarmati Riverfront, Jama MAsjid, and The Adalaj Stepwell, which are the popular visiting places in Ahmedabad.
```{R}
library(knitr)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```
```{R}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lat=23.0608, lng=72.5809, popup="Gandhi Ashram, Ahmedabad") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=23.0063, lng=72.6026, popup="Kankaria Lake, Ahmedabad") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=23.0270, lng=72.5810, popup="Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, Ahmedabad") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=23.0235, lng=72.5766, popup="Sabarmati Riverfront, Ahmedabad") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=23.0239, lng=72.5871, popup="Jama Masjid, Ahmedabad") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=23.1667, lng=72.5801, popup="The Adalaj Stepwell, Ahmedabad") %>%
  setView (lat=23.0608, lng=72.5809, zoom=16) 
m  # Print the map
```

## Mapping Clusters

When you zoom in to each cluster, the cluster will seperate until you see the individual Markers!!

```{R, message = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(lat=runif(500, min=23.00, max = 23.10),
                 lng=runif(500, min=72.50, max = 72.60))
```
```{R}
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
